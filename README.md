Social-Terminal, as the name suggests, is a terminal based networking platform. Unlike other social platforms, it deals with new projects, startups, and technology. Suppose if there is a group who are planning for a startup and wants to form a group of highly skilled CSE engineers, they would post their small concise description and skill set they want. Or there can be another situation where one has an incomplete project but sees its potential thereby has posted it on this platform. now when a normal user logs in to his account, he will be shown a dashboard consisting of above mentioned two categories of posts. he can simply like it, comment on it or can join it. remember in startup project we don't want any person with the skill set other than mentioned in the post. but same is not the case with incomplete projects where anyone can join. on each join request, author of the post gets notified about new join request and gets to see his details and thereafter decides to accept or reject. once accepted that member will be notified and original post will now show one more description about team members. this part will be same for incomplete projects.

This project is capable of multiple client connectivity and uses redis as the database .
